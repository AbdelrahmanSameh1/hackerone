# hackerone
I have collected all hackerone disclosed reports by brute forcing on their api https://api.hackerone.com/v1/hackers/reports/{id} from number 1 to 1500000.

May be there are more reports, that it's id is more than 1500000.

File reports.csv contain more than 10000 disclosed report, every line have report_id, link, title, state.

you can use h1_reports.py script to do the same thing.

happy reading
